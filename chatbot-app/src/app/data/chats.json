Consider what your goals are and what you want to build to help you decide which language to start with.\n\n2. Set up your development environment: Download and install the necessary software tools for coding in your chosen language. This may include an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a simple text editor.\n\n3. Start with the basics: Begin by learning the fundamental concepts of programming, such as variables, data types, loops, and functions. Many online resources, tutorials, and courses are available for beginners.\n\n4. Practice coding: The best way to learn how to code is by practicing and writing code regularly. Start with small projects and gradually increase the complexity as you become more comfortable with the language.\n\n5. Join a coding community: Joining a coding community or forum can be a great way to connect with other programmers, ask for help, and share your progress. Sites like Stack Overflow, GitHub, and Reddit have active coding communities.\n\n6. Work on projects: A great way to apply your coding skills is by working on real-world projects. This will help you gain practical experience and build a portfolio of work that you can show to potential employers.\n\n7. Learn from your mistakes: Don't be afraid to make mistakes while coding. Debugging and troubleshooting are important parts of the coding process and can help you learn and grow as a programmer.\n\n8. Stay updated: The field of programming is constantly evolving, so it's important to stay updated on new technologies, languages, and best practices. Follow coding blogs, attend workshops, and participate in online courses to continue learning and improving your skills.",

You can build on this code to add more routes, middleware, and business logic as needed for your backend application.",
